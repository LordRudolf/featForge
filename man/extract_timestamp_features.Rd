\usage{
extract_timestamp_features(
  timestamps,
  date_of_birth = NULL,
  error_on_invalid = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{timestamps}{A vector of timestamps, either as \code{POSIXct} or \code{Date} objects.}

\item{date_of_birth}{An optional vector of client dates of birth. If provided, it must have the same length as \code{timestamps},
enabling computation of age and birthday-related features.}

\item{error_on_invalid}{Logical flag specifying whether to throw an error (\code{TRUE}) or a warning (\code{FALSE}, default)
when missing or invalid timestamp values are detected.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the extracted timestamp features and birthday-related features (if \code{date_of_birth} is provided).
}
\description{
This function extracts various features from application timestamps and, if provided, client dates of birth.
It supports both \code{POSIXct} and \code{Date} objects for \code{timestamps}. If the timestamps are given as \code{Date} objects,
note that features requiring intra-day granularity (e.g., \code{timestamp_hour}) will not be created, and some cyclic features may be less precise.
}
\details{
The function returns a data frame containing the following variables:
\describe{
  \item{timestamp_month}{Numeric. Month extracted from the timestamp (1 to 12).}
  \item{timestamp_month_sine}{Numeric. Sine transformation of the month (using period = 12).}
  \item{timestamp_month_cosine}{Numeric. Cosine transformation of the month (using period = 12).}
  \item{timestamp_day_of_month}{Numeric. Day of the month extracted from the timestamp (1 to 31).}
  \item{timestamp_day_of_month_sine}{Numeric. Sine transformation of the day of the month (using period = 31).}
  \item{timestamp_day_of_month_cosine}{Numeric. Cosine transformation of the day of the month (using period = 31).}
  \item{timestamp_week_of_year}{Numeric. ISO week number extracted from the timestamp (typically 1 to 52, but may be 53 in some years).}
  \item{timestamp_week_of_year_sine}{Numeric. Sine transformation of the week of the year (using period = 52).}
  \item{timestamp_week_of_year_cosine}{Numeric. Cosine transformation of the week of the year (using period = 52).}
  \item{timestamp_day_of_week}{Numeric. Day of the week extracted from the timestamp (1 for Monday through 7 for Sunday).}
  \item{timestamp_day_of_week_sine}{Numeric. Sine transformation of the day of the week (using period = 7).}
  \item{timestamp_day_of_week_cosine}{Numeric. Cosine transformation of the day of the week (using period = 7).}
  \item{timestamp_hour}{Numeric. Hour of the day (0 to 23). This is only available if \code{timestamps} are of class \code{POSIXct}.}
  \item{timestamp_hour_sine}{Numeric. Sine transformation of the hour (using period = 24).}
  \item{timestamp_hour_cosine}{Numeric. Cosine transformation of the hour (using period = 24).}
  \item{client_age_at_application}{Numeric. Client's age at the time of application, calculated in years (real number).}
  \item{days_to_birthday}{Numeric. Number of days until the client's next birthday.}
  \item{days_to_birthday_cosine}{Numeric. Cosine transformation of the days to birthday (using period = 365).}
}

The function first validates the inputs and then extracts the following features:
\itemize{
  \item Extracts date-based features such as year, month, day of month, ISO week of the year, and day of the week.
  \item If timestamps are of class \code{POSIXct}, it also extracts the hour of the day.
  \item Applies cyclic transformations (using sine and cosine functions) to the month, day of month, week of year, day of week,
        and hour variables so that their cyclical nature is maintained in machine learning models.
  \item If \code{date_of_birth} is provided, computes the client's age at the time of application and the number of days
        until their next birthday, along with a cosine transformation for the latter.
