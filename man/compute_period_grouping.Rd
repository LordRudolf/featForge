\usage{
compute_period_grouping(time_vec, scrape_date, obs_start, period)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_vec}{A vector of transaction dates (Date or POSIXct).}

\item{scrape_date}{A single date representing the scrape date for the application.}

\item{obs_start}{A single date representing the observation window start for the application.}

\item{period}{A character string ("daily", "weekly" (starts from Monday), "monthly"), a function, or a vector.
If a function, it should accept time_vec and return a vector of the same length.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
  \code{period_group}: a vector (of the same length as time_vec) with the period label
  for each transaction (or NA if the transaction does not fall in a full period).
  \code{all_periods}: a sorted vector of all complete periods available.
}
\description{
This function computes a period grouping variable for a set of transaction dates
given the scrape date and observation window start for a single application.
}
